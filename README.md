# [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)
+ This repository contains the solutions that I have come up with.
+ I will keep updating as I solve new ones.
+ If you have any doubts regarding any solution you can mail me to m.patel199821@gmail.com
+ python is the programming language that I prefer the most due to its simplicity.
